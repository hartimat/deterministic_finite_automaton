# Welcome to "deterministic_finite_automaton"!

## [ DESCRIPTION ]

This repo is an implementation of a deterministic finite state manchine (automaton) in C.



## [ BACKGROUND ]

This project was part of the coursework for Principles of Programming.  I chose to implement the DFA in C because I had not previously used the language.  The program prompts the user to either create a new DFA based on their input, or to load an existing DFA from a text file.



## [ CHALLENGES ]

This project was my first exposure to the C language.  Therefore I experienced a learning curve while getting used to the basic syntax, defining structs, dealing with function prototypes, etc.  "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie proved to be a very helpful resource and I would recommend it to anyone. 



## [ LESSONS AND SKILLS LEARNED ]

This project gave me exposure to C and a look into the additional control it gives the user over what they are doing in memory, etc. compared to more high-level programming languages.
